note that there is only one license for the project as a whole. The below is both an alternate 
summary/application of relevant parts of the license and a clarification of special circumstances 
that you as the user will need to abide by. If in doubt, refer to the legal code directly.

Part 2: Further Statements
- Mentions of "file" refer to this project and its contained resources.

- This license may appear to permit redistributions as is. However, I myself am not allowed to permit 
such acts of distribution. Even with this CC license, scenarios of verbatim redistributions likely
